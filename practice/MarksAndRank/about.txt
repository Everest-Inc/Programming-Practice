Given the name, marks in three subjects i.e. Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics of 3 students, we need to calculate the percentage, 
division and rank, assuming that the total marks for each subject is 100 and then print the Name, Percentage, Division and Rank of the 
in accending order of rank.

Example:
Input:
  Abc
  80 80 80
  Bcd
  40 40 40
  Def
  70 70 70
Output:
  Name: Abc
  Percentage: 80.0
  Division: A
  Rank: 1
  
  Name: Def
  Percentage: 70.0
  Division: B
  Rank: 2
  
  Name: Bcd
  Percentage: 40.0
  Division: D
  Rank: 3
 
 Note: You can use your own logic while calculating the division
