Given an array of 'n' numbers not exceeding range 'max' (inclusively), we need to print the distinct numbers in that array.

Input:
  1. 'max' (which is the maximum value a number can have in the array)
  2. 'n' unknown numbers within range 'max' (inclusively)

Note: 'max' <= 100

Output:
  'n' space separated distinct numbers
  
Example:
  Input:
    Enter max: 10
    Numbers: 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 5 10 10 9 1 2 8 4
  Output:
    0 1 2 3 4 5 8 9 10
