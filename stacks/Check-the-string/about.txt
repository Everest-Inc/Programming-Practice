there is a bot which knows only about the string "ab" or "". It can insert that string i.e. "ab" or "" in any place between ab. 
We need to find out that whether a string containing only 'a' and 'b' is made by that bot.
Eg: ab -> true
	  aabb -> true
    
    Explaination: initially, there is ab, now inserting next "ab" in between existing ab, we get "aabb"
    
    Similarly, "aababb", "abaabb", "aabaabbb" are also made by the bot is these strings are made by randomly inserting "ab" in resulting 
    strings.

But, strings like "aaab", "abba", "bbabba" are not made by the bot.
